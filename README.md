This app is developed for coding test with following features.

I've develop this app only using props and states. (not including any storage feature like Asyncstorage or etc due to time limit.)

Features are as follow,

- Show null on the name and age field on first
launch
- Go to second screen and insert the data
- Your app should grab the location by GPS
- Take photo button – take picture and place
the image on top of input fields
- Submit button – Press the submit button and
pass the name and age data to first screen
